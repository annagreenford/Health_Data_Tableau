# Health_Data_Tableau## 

Using the GlobalHealth data set, conduct an analysis to find trends and key information that could be used by an organisation for future support.

The Tableau Dashboard image incldes an animated map and chart on the left, showing how the numbers of identified cancers has increased between 1990 and 2008 across the world, but particularly in Europe and Northern America. 

I couldn’t get the no. of cancers as a proportion of the population to behave in charts – it would only sum %’s for each year/region etc. and I couldn’t calculate averages (when dragging the measure to the column/row it automatically defines an ‘AGG’ type and I can’t work out how to change this. 

The chart at the bottom right demonstrates how the numbers can be misleading.  This shows a strong positive correlation between cholesterol levels and life expectancy (as cholesterol levels increase, so does life expectancy) – but this does not indicate causality!
